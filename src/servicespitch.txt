Introduction to avalable services newline 

As a Full Stack developer I can create an entire web application. This includes creating the front end or visual 
web servers that provide API's, and databases. I host web apps on Heroku or DigitalOcean hosting services. I prefer to work with google domains for name server newline

Front end services newline

I provide web browser experiences featuring dynamic pages, and multipage applications. Although I prefer to work with your
layout and assets, I can provide some design and images. My front ends are custom coded providing the greatest flexibility in
function. I use the React development framework that creates extremly fast sites and shorten development time for lower 
costs to you. The web applications can be stand alone or in conjuntion with a backend server. newline

Backend services newline

I can provide backend services including Private or public API's to give your existing web sites additional functionality, or 
public API's consumption to be sold as a service or consumed within you orginsation. I also create Databases for information 
storage such as inventory or clients. I use the JavaScript programming language for my backend code to increase efficiency. 
I can create Databases using the older SQL architecture capable of handling larger datasets, or a document orientated database 
that shortens development time.
